## Overview
This portfolio displays my projects dynamically, highlighting my web development and UI/UX skills.  
It includes both school projects and personal projects, with interactive filtering and responsive design for desktop and mobile.

## Features
- **Dynamic project display:**
    - The two most recent projects appear on `index.html`.
    - All projects are listed on `work.html` from most recent to oldest.
- **Category filtering:** Users can filter projects by "School" or "Personal", clicking again resets the filter.
- **Project counters:** `<sup>` dynamically shows the number of projects in each category.
- **Responsive design:** Mobile and desktop layouts are fine-tuned to fit the screen.
- **Project images:** Each project includes multiple images to showcase details.
- **Source inspection deterrence:** Basic client-side techniques are used to discourage casual source inspection. This is intended for educational purposes only and does not provide real security.
- **Educational disclaimers:** All logos and third-party content are used for educational purposes only.

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3 (including flexbox for layout)
- JavaScript (dynamic filtering, DOM manipulation, basic interaction handling)
- Figma (for UI/UX design)
- Photoshop (for project compositing and UI mockups)
- Blender (for 3D modeling and rendering)

## Usage
- Navigate to `index.html` to see the two most recent projects.
- Click "Work" to see all projects.
